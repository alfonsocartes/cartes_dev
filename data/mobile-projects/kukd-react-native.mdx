# Kukd.com React Native App

Kukd.com is an app written with Expo (React Native) for iOS and Android devices.

The experience with React Native and Expo has been great. You can take a look at a blog post I wrote about [why you should pick it for your next project.](https://cartes.dev/blog/posts/why-react-native-for-your-business)

This project is a food delivery app with table booking, menu, cart, payment, order tracking and user accounts.
