# Remember The Car

SwiftUI test project. Take a look at the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/alfonsocartes/rememberthecar) and save your car's parked position with a simple and fast iOS app. Save location, take a photo of where you parked and set a timer for a reminder.

I used SwiftUI when it was first launched as a test example app.

APIs:

- SwiftUI
- MapKit
- Camera
- Photo Picker
- Local Notifications
- Local save and loading from User Defaults

<Carousel post="remember-the-car" />

## Why another car parking app?

I wanted a **fast** and simple app just to save my car position when I parked.

Other features: a button to get walking directions, save a note and a photo to remember things like parking levels and location and a simple timer with a notification for when the parking has a timer.
