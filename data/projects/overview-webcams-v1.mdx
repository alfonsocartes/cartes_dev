# Overview Webcams (version 1)

<AppStoreButton url="http://www.apple.com"/>
<PlayStoreButton url=""/>

Overview webcams is an app made with Flutter for iOS and Android devices.

I used MaterialUI as the design framework for unification between iOS and Android.

<!-- ** Take a look at the [AnyLeft website](https://anyleft.cartes.dev) -->

## Why a webcams app?

There is a constant in my interests: **digital maps**. I have always been facinated with learning about different places and specially having access to them with a digital map in the palm of my hand.

One of the steps was to see places all over the world in real or almost real time so i decided it would be a great project.

The market for the apps are a lot of apps that are not really well made or really expensive and focused on one part of the world. I wan to have access to as many webcam providers as I can and offer the users an easy and affordable way of accessing them.

## Why Flutter?

I picked Flutter because at the time I was really exited about learning a new framework. Even though this was my second Flutter app (the fist one was [AnyLeft]()), I wanted to make a simple app that used a Rest API and a Map Widget with markes that where shown depending on the region shown in the screen of the user's device.

The great thing about Flutter is that you can write one code base and deploy it as a compiled native app in iOS and Android.

## Why no permanent storage?

The app uses a Rest API to get the webcams information.

There is no backend for this version because I just display the information that I get from the API.  

I only save the user's last position. That way it's centered in it the next time the user opens the app.
