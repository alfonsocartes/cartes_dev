# cartes.dev (Wordpress)

**cartes.dev** was a professional website with a portfolio and a blog developed with Wordpress using the LAMP Stack.

## Technologies

- WordPress
- LAMP Stack
- Linux Server
- Elementor
- Jetpack
- Yoast SEO
- Social Network Connections

The website was made to showcase my projects and for people to find a little more about me. It’s made in WordPress as a placeholder for a future ReactJS Serverless SSG site that I’m working on.
