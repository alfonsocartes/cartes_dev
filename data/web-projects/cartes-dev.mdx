## Technology Stack Used

- [Javascript (ECMAScript)](https://tc39.es/ecma262/): ECMAScript (or ES) is a JavaScript standard meant to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different web browsers. It is standardized by Ecma International according to the document ECMA-262. ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. React documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains" advising it to developers as a solution when "Building a server-rendered website with Node.js". Where traditional React apps can only render their content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this functionality to include applications rendered on the server side.
- [Next.js Static Site Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages): Next.js Static Site Generation (SSG) is a feature of Next.js that allows you to generate static websites from your Next.js application.
- [Next.js Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization): Next.js Image Optimization is a feature of Next.js that allows you to optimize images in your Next.js application.
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.
- [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx): MDX is a framework for writing React components that can be used to render Markdown files.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for quickly creating complex responsive layouts.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): Vercel is a platform for deploying and hosting static websites.
