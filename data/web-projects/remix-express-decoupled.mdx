# Remix Jokes with a decoupled Node.js API

### What's this project about?

You can take a look at the [blog post](https://cartes.dev/blog/posts/remix-express-decoupled) for more details.

## Monorepo and Multirepo

I made two projects. One is a monorepo and the other is a multirepo.

### [Monorepo project](https://github.com/alfonsocartes/remix-jokes-decoupled-monorepo)

- The monorepo project shares Prisma generated Typescript types because it shares the Prisma Client dependency in the root node_modules folder.

- **TODO:** GitHub Actions for remix-jokes-backend have not been tested since it's now a monorepo.

### [Multirepo project](https://github.com/alfonsocartes/remix-jokes-decoupled-multirepo)

- **TODO:** Because this is not a monorepo, we cannot generate the types for Prisma in the common root node_modules folder that includes @prisma/client. The current solution is to use the remix-jokes-frontend/app/prisma.d.ts file that contains a copy of the generated types but we hace to do this manually. There are multiple solutions for this that include things such as: npm package, git submodule, symlinks, and many more.
