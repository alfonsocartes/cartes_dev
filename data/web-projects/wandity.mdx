## Full-Stack Remix Frontend - Express.js Rest APIs

**You can take a look at [wandity.com](https://wandity.com) for more details.**

### What's this project about?

It's a social network for travellers that consists of a full-stack Remix project with two decoupled backend APIs using Express.js

### How is it built?

Each backend API is built with its own PostgreSQL database, a Prisma ORM interface (shared with the Remix frontend using NPM public packages), a Redis cache layer and uses Express.js as the Node.js framework.

#### Wandity Users API

The first backend is a Typescript Express.js Rest API that handles authentication and authorization, user information, payments and a credit system. The auth is made using JWT with refresh tokens and Redis, for payments I use Stripe and everything is stored and connected using Prisma and PostgreSQL.

#### Wandity Community API

The second backend is also a Typescript Express.js Rest API that handles everything regarding the community like post entries, comments, votes, an innovative public feed system using credits and Stripe payments, subscriptions to other users, memberships and so many other things.

Users can create their unique user profile, link to their social networks, upload images, optimized on the backend with sharp and stored on AWS S3. Images are also analysed with AI using Amazon Rekognition. The backend also generate link previews using Puppeteer and OpenGraph data.

#### Wandity Remix Frontend

The frontend is made using Remix, React and TailwindCSS using web platform APIs and progressive enhancement. React is only used for improving the user experience when javascript is loaded in the browser.

#### Deployment

Finally, the three projects are deployed using Docker containers with CI/CD to Fly.io for using microVMs and replication to multiple regions.

### What's the stack?

Stack: Remix, React, Tailwindcss, Express.js, Node.js, JWT, Refresh Tokens, Redis, Prisma, PostgreSQL, AWS S3, Amazon Rekognition, Docker, CI/CD and a few others.
