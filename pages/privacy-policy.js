            DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
            communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
            online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we
            will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
            Privacy Policy./Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems
            and our mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature
            or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
            have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
            collected. If you set the DNT signal on your browser, we will
            respond to such DNT browser signals.
